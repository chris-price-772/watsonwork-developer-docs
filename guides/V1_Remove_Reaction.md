# Remove a Reaction

## Concepts

The _removeReaction_ mutation allows the API caller to remove a reaction from a message.  The mutation accepts a Message ID (targetId) and a reaction as arguments, and makes the request on behalf of the caller, removing the specified reaction from the message.  The result will reflect the current **count** of users that reacted with the same **reaction** (string/emoji), and **viewerHasReacted** as to whether the caller has reacted (false).

## Schema

### Remove Reaction Mutation



```graphql
type MutationRoot {
  ...
  removeReaction(input: RemoveReactionInput!): RemoveReactionMutation
}

type Reaction {
  reaction: String!
  count: Int
  viewerHasReacted: Boolean!
}

type RemoveReactionMutation {
  reaction: Reaction!
}

type RemoveReactionInput {
  targetId: String!
  reaction: String!
}
```
