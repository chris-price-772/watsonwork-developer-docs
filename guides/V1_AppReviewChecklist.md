## App review checklist

Our review team will review your app and approve or reject based on 7 areas, **Architecture**, **Design Quality**,
**Business Value**, **Legal Due Diligence**, **Security**,  **Support** and **Sustainability**. You’ll find the details
around each area described below. Please review each area and prepare to provide us with the items called out. Once you
submit your app for review, we will contact you via email to collect the information needed and provide you with feedback.
Learn how to submit your app for review by clicking [here](./V1_PublishInTheCatalog.md).

## Architecture

We want to make sure your app follows best practices and uses our APIs as we’ve intended.

**Deliverables**

* Provide detailed description of the app architecture including a bill of materials and integration points with our services. 
* Provide expected (or observed) scalability and performance benchmarks and estimates.

## Design quality

We want to make sure apps fit in with the our design principles. Also, please don’t make your design overly similar to other apps, yours needs to have its own distinctive design. And apps should be complete, all features must work as advertised.

**Deliverables**

* Provide access to video, click-through or live demonstrations with narrative for us to evaluate. Note, the descriptions, screenshots and demos must depict the app accurately. The app should not include hidden, undocumented or overlooked features. Demos should show actual use.
* Also if authentication is required, give a set of test credentials to access the app directly.

## Business Value

Your App must provide a clear benefit to the user while enriching the Watson Workspace experience.

Objectionable content within the app or posted by the app on a space transcript including links to Web sites hosting
objectionable content is strictly prohibited. We reserve the right to classify something as objectionable as per IBM’s Guidelines.

Defamatory or mean-spirited content, including references or commentary about religion, race, sexual orientation, gender,
or other targeted groups, particularly if the app is likely to place a targeted individual or group in harm’s way is
strictly prohibited.

Depictions that encourage illegal or reckless use of weapons and dangerous objects, or facilitate the purchase of firearms is
strictly prohibited.

Overtly sexual or pornographic material, defined by Webster’s Dictionary as "explicit descriptions or displays of sexual
organs or activities intended to stimulate erotic rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings” is strictly prohibited.

Content depicting any form of animal cruelty is strictly prohibited.

Inflammatory religious commentary or inaccurate or misleading quotations of religious texts is strictly prohibited.

False information and features, including inaccurate device data or trick/joke functionality, such as fake location trackers
is strictly prohibited.

Apps that enable anonymous or prank phone calls or SMS/MMS messaging are  strictly prohibited.

A way for users to report offensive content and an established process for addressing concerns must be evident and
called out to the review team.

Embedding Watson Work Services in an app should enhance the value of the app in a clear and measurable way.

## Legal Due Diligence

There are two aspects here you need to insure. First, that you are the owner of the intellectual property of your app.
Additionally, we want you to make sure you provide clear teams of use to the users of your app, so they understand what
they’re agreeing to when then add your app. If your app collects and shares user or usage data you must make this clear
to the user and secure their consent.

**Deliverables**

* Provide proof you have secured the rights to your app’s assets including names, icons, screenshots, etc. 
* Provide links to terms-of-use and privacy documentation.
* Provide the flow of how the app allows the user to consent to allow the app to gather user or usage data. 

## Security

Your app needs to provide measures to protect user and usage data.

**Deliverables**

* Provide a description of the app’s security architecture and user flow.

## Support

You need to provide an easy way for users to understand the available functionality in your app, and it must be
accurate, easy to navigate and easy to digest.

* Provide a link to your app’s help center and user documentation. Also call out any “in app” content or guidance
that is included.

## Sustainability

We want to insure to users that they can rely on your apps, for now and going forward. You need to have a planned or
established delivery cadence and roadmap. You must have a method to determine whether the app is live at any point in time.
Provide description to IBM on how this is configured to support high-availability of the app. Also, as part of your agreement
in publishing your app, you must agree to inform us of any changes to the app that will impact its lifecycle,
functionality or content.

**Deliverables**

* Provide short-term delivery plan and description of how users will access your delivery plan and roadmap.
* Provide a statement of commitment that you will inform us of any changes to the app that will impact its lifecycle, functionality or content.
