# Delete a message

## Concepts

The _deleteMessage_ mutation allows the user to delete a message. Currently this is only applicable to messages which have been authored by the user. The mutation accepts a Message ID as an argument and makes the request on behalf of the calling user.

## Schema

### Delete Message Mutation



```graphql
type MutationRoot {
  ...
  deleteMessage(input: DeleteMessageInput!): DeleteOutput
}

type DeleteOutput {
  successful: Boolean!
}

type DeleteMessageInput {
  id: String!
}
```
