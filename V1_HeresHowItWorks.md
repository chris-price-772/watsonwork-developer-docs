## Here’s how it works

Basic Collaboration Flow.

If you want to see how things work here, let’s start with the basics. In this series, you can see that, like any collaboration service, people can share messages through a conversation.

How Watson contributes

In Watson Work Services there’s a whole lot more going on. Watson analyzes the content and will generate its analysis, and share it by making use of the concept of Annotations. Annotations are meta information that is appended to things like messages in a conversation. You can learn about the details by [clicking here](guides/V1_annotations.md).

How Watson understands the conversation

And there’s more, in addition to analyizing things like messages, Watson Work Services also can see across a period of time and group, fiter and summarize the most relevant items, and entities, providing an understanding. This capability is called Moments, and if you want to learn more, [click here](guides/V1_wwsg_MomentIdentification.md).
